Important dates:
11/20   Rough draft due. Wednesday, November 20 during lab (4:10pm lab time). Rough draft is pretty open, just need something for the teacher and/or TA to look over and give feedback on. Acceptable rough draft could be just a single page of the website, but complete.
12/4    Final project due.

Extra notes:
The next few lecture times we might cover some content for the course, but much of time should also be for us to be able to ask questions and get help and answers from the teacher on our final project.
